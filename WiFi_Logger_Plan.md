\# 🧭 ESP8266 ADC Logger – Development Plan



A high-level breakdown of this learning-based embedded project.



---



\## ✅ Milestone 1: Core Logger (Completed)

\- \[x] Setup Arduino IDE + Board Manager

\- \[x] Connect to Wi-Fi using ESP8266

\- \[x] Read ADC value from pin A0

\- \[x] Send value via HTTP GET to ThingSpeak

\- \[x] View data on dashboard

\- \[x] Serial monitor working with debug logs



---



\## 🔄 Milestone 2: Improve Logger Output (Next)

\- \[ ] Add timestamps using NTP or manual ticks

\- \[ ] Format JSON output with additional fields

\- \[ ] Retry logic for network drops



---



\## 🔋 Milestone 3: Display \& Power

\- \[ ] Add OLED or LCD display for live ADC values

\- \[ ] Add LED indicator for successful POST

\- \[ ] Explore deep sleep and wakeup methods



---



\## 🌐 Milestone 4: Protocol Upgrade

\- \[ ] Replace HTTP with MQTT (e.g., HiveMQ or Mosquitto)

\- \[ ] Explore REST API or publish to Firebase

\- \[ ] Secure connection with TLS



---



\## 🧪 Bonus Ideas

\- Build a simple dashboard on Raspberry Pi

\- Write a Python script to pull + visualize ThingSpeak data

\- Package it as a reusable sensor module
